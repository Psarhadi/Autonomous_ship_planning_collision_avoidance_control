# Integrated_Risk_Assessment_and_Collision_Avoidance_a_Maritime_Autonomous_Surface_Ship_MASS




This repo includes a practical waypoint tracking, online risk assessment, collison avoidance, control, as well implelemted on a simulation of a MASS. The mission planning includes Line of Sight (LOS), Cross Tracking Error (CTE) and Collision Avoidance (COLAV) terms. The contoller is a PD, and the vehicle model is a simple yet realistic model of a vessel. A Fuzzy online collision risk assessment is also provided. You can change the initial conditions to simulate different scenarios.
