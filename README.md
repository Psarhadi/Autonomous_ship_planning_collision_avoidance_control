This repo includes the Python implementation of practical waypoint tracking, online risk assessment, collision avoidance, and control algorithms, all implemented in a simulation of a MASS. The mission planning incorporates Line of Sight (LOS), Cross-Track Error (CTE), and Collision Avoidance (COLAV) terms [1]. The controller is a PD, and the vehicle model is a simple yet realistic representation of a vessel with stochastic disturbances. A fuzzy online collision risk assessment is also provided. Finally, it visualises the motion and saves the animation outcome. Users can modify the initial conditions to simulate different scenarios.

An LLM-based decision-making algorithm is also proposed and integrated into this system, with its description available in [2]. Feel free to amend and use the code with citations.
