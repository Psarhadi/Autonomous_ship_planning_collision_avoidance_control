This repo includes the Python implementation of practical waypoint tracking, online risk assessment, collision avoidance, and control algorithms, all implemented in a simulation of a MASS. The mission planning incorporates Line of Sight (LOS), Cross-Track Error (CTE), and Collision Avoidance (COLAV) terms [1]. The controller is a PD, and the vehicle model is a simple yet realistic representation of a vessel with stochastic disturbances. A fuzzy online collision risk assessment is also provided. Users can modify the initial conditions to simulate different scenarios.

An LLM based decision-making algorithm is also proposed and augmented to this system that its descripts can be found in [2].
